# WildFireSmokeDetection 
Submission for hackathon conducted by AI For Mankind (https://aiformankind.org/) to early detect WildFire smoke . See details of hackathon at https://aiformankind.org/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon-2.0/


Thanks to AIForManKind for providing Quick Start Demo https://github.com/aiformankind/wildfire-smoke-detection-camera
and providning label Image Data Set.

### Saved Model
Submitted fined tune model is with EfficientDet-d3 using TensorFlow.

Data Set - 737 images. After augmenting (Horizontal Flip and added brightness form 0% to 23%). 

   Training Images : 1739
   Validation Images : 111
   

#### How to do Training and Inference

See [Model Training notebook](smoke_detection_model/notebooks/Model_Training_efficientdet_d3.ipynb)

To model inference form saved model refer to [inference notebook](smoke_detection_model/notebooks/smoke_detection_Inference_efficientdet-d3.ipynb)

Training done on Google Colab with Tesla K80 GPU.

### Challenges
- We tried several other models 1) YOLOV5 2) SSD Mobile to solve this problem, but in results we found some limitations with some pattern of images.
- With YOLOV5 with our dataset full smoke images were not detected properly.
- Segmentation part of this problem is also tried with Detectron2 model by preparing data from Labelme and then converted it to COCO with labelme2coco.py.
- AP factor for segmenatation part was very less, so we are not including with our results.
- Data generated by us for segmentation with LabelMe and labelme2coco.py was not giving "regions" in json file which was issue with our data for segmentation.
